	* headers.gperf (Repository): 
		Downcased everything. Fixed up some missing / mis-spelled
		Header::Type entries.

	* Symbols.cxx (Repository): 
		Fixed up Litteral text (STRING) for:
			Subscription_State
			Refer_To
			Referred_By
			

	* Makefile (Repository): Added rule for headers-hash.c.
		Builds hash function from headers.gperf.
		NOTE: Needs manual downcasing.

	* HeaderTypes.hxx (Repository): Fixed up Timestamp and
		Call-Info fields to return correct STRING represenatation.
