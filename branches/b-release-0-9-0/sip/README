This is resiprocate.

This project provides a robust, complete library implementing
the various IETF standards defining SIP. It handles the details
of managing transports and SIP transactions, and provides a
higher level abstraction library (named the Dialog Usage Manager,
or DUM) to deal with the SIP-level requirements for managing
INVITE-usages, Subscriptions, and other SIP dialog components. 

Building/Installing:
  (./configure; make; make check; make install) 
  See INSTALL for more details

Obtaining the current source:
  The source for this release is available via subversion using
  svn co http://scm.sipfoundry.org/rep/resiprocate/branches/b-release-0-9-0

  The current development branch (code at the bleeding edge) for resiprocate
  can be obtained using
  svn co http://scm.sipfoundry.org/rep/resiprocate/main

Creating an application based on the stack: 

  Set your compilation environment up such that the "sip" directory
  is in the include path. Your source should use #include directives 
  that look like:
     #include "resiprocate/SipStack.hxx"

  Set the library path to include wherever you configured library
  installation and pass "-lresiprocate"  to the linker. If you are
  using any part of DUM, also include "-ldum".

  The release tarball contains an autotools build system that uses
  libtool. If you are also using libtool for your project, you can
  point it at the resiprocate build instead of at the installed
  libraries and it should do the right thing.
