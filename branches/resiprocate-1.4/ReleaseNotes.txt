= Release Notes v 1.4 =

==General==
===New features===
* Working with installed resip headers/libs no longer requires setting the USE_SSL and USE_IPV6 preprocessor macros to avoid API/ABI mismatch issues

==Build system==
===New features===
* better cross-compilation support

==rutil==
===New features===
* added a faster implementation of std::ostream

===Bug fixes===
* more work on bad asserts in the dns code

==stack==
===New features===
* modified TlsConnection so that if a domain certificate is present, then it will be loaded and assigned to TLS client connections (as well as the TLS Server connections).  This allows resip to return a certificate to the Server if it asks for one (ie. MTLS servers).  Note: Errors are only logged or thrown when the certificate is not present in the store for TLS Server connections.
* updated some documentation on what standards headers are defined in
* added SipStack::abandonServerTransaction(), which allows a TU to tell the stack to abandon a given server transaction, without requiring the TU to send a response
* added SipStack::cancelClientInviteTransaction(), which allows a TU to tell the stack to CANCEL a client INVITE transaction; the stack handles the sending of the CANCEL (including waiting for a provisional to come in if it hasn't already)
* added SipStack::setFixBadCSeqNumbers(), which can configure the stack to automatically ensure that the CSeq number in responses matches the CSeq number in the request

===Bug fixes===
* fixed a bug in parsing of embedded headers in a Uri
* various fixes to the select loop
* fixed a place in the multipart contents code that was doing case-sensitive comparisons on "Content-Type"
* fixed a bug where a transport parameter was added to the Contact uri when the Contact uri had a gr parameter
* fix for a timing issue in resip TLS code (SSL trying to write data before TCP connect was ready)
* improved the certificate name match (wildcards match for subjectAltName and case insensitive match for commonName)
* fixed a bug where calling SipMessage::getContents() when the Content-Type header was malformed would cause an exception to be thrown
* fixed a couple of bugs in SipMessage where an empty single-value header would cause exceptions to be thrown
* fixed a bug where message-decorators could be run twice on outgoing messages if a DNS failover occurred

==DUM==
===New features===
* GRUU support
* dialog event support
* more flexible configuration of min, max, and default expires values in ServerRegistration and ServerSubscription
* add an accessor to InviteSession to get the remote contact header - remoteTarget

===Bug fixes===
* fixed a bug where calling ClientRegistration::refresh while a previous REGISTER was pending would cause another REGISTER request to be sent.
* fixed a bug where INFO requests were not handled correctly in a server invite session
* in ClientSubscription
** ensure we don't retry if end() was called
** don't use mRemoteTarget when creating new retry Subscriptions
** mid-dialog 4xx retry error will no longer create a new dialog - refresh is retried instead

==repro==
===Bug fixes===
* allow forking to both outbound and non-outbound target simultaneously
* fix for repro crash when deleting two ACL members at the same time from the web interface
* fix for WIN32 to catch exceptions thrown from WinCompat::getInterfaces
