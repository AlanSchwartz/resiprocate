		I've been working on an SIMPLE client - it is really basic and still does many things wrong but is something people could start playing with It is still alpha quality and most likely won't work.
		<p>Right now it is just on windows - there is a curses based version that runs on Unix but that hardly counts. The SMIME stuff still needs work for key ring management stuff and the TLS has not really been tested with</p>
		<p>You can download the windows install program at</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/SipIMPSetup.msi" target="_blank">http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/SipIMPSetup.msi</a></p>
		<p>If this does not work for you and claims you need a more recent installer then download all the files in</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/SipImpSetup.zip" target="_blank">http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/SipImpSetup.zip</a> unzip and run setup</p>
		<p>My configuration looks like</p>
		<p><img src="./ConfigImage.gif" align="baseline" border="0"></p>
		<p>12.234.50.3 is the public address of my NAT and I have forwarded port 5002 on it to the private address of my computer I run this on. I also needed to set my local port to be 5002. If I was not behind a NAT I would leave the contact blank.</p>
		<p>The source code is all open source it is checked into the CVS at <a href="http://www.vovida.org">www.vovida.org</a> under the project vocal/sip2. Set your CVSROOT to :pserver:anonymous@cvs.vovida.org:/cvsroot - the password is anonymous. There is an (old by the time you read this) zip file of the source at <a href="http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/SipImpSrc.zip">http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/SipImpSrc.zip</a></p>
		<p>If you want to try the TLS or S/MIME stuff - it is currently complicated and I don't really recommend it unless you like playing with sort of stuff. You need to download the install file at <a href="http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/Sec/SipIMPSetup.msi" target="_blank">http://www.employees.org/~fluffy/sipimp/Sec/SipIMPSetup.msi</a>. You then need to get the openssl DLLs. You can compile version 0.9.7 from <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org </a>using vc or you can try and find a copy of the 0.9.7 versions of libeay32.dll and ssleay32.lib somewhere on the web. I have not had much luck finding them. You need to copy the dlls to the same directory where the program is installed.</p>
