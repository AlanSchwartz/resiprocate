The DialogUsamgeManger (or DUM) is the unit that keeps track of all the data
sturcutres and sits on top of the transaction layer of the stack. It keeps track
of multiple DialogSet which contains Dialogs. Each DialogSet contains all the
Dialog that were created by a common initial request. They all share the same
SIP Call-Id and from tag from the orginal request. Inside a specific dialogSet
there can be some type of BaseCreator that represnets the intial request that
generated the dialog. This will only exist onthe UAC side. The DialogSet also
contains serveral objects dereived from BaseUsage that are using this particular
dialog. There are several types of things that are a Usage of this dialog. There
can be one InvSession, one Registration, one Publication, multiple Subscriptions
and multiple OutOfDialogRequests. Note the name OutOfDialog is a little weird -
they are actually in a thing a lot like a dialog but are transactions that are
not in one of the other categories. Typically messages that result in
OutOfDialogRequests are MESSAGE and OPTIONS.
</p><p>
An initial SIP Request is created by calling the makeX interfaces on the DUM. It
is then sent using the send interface on the DUM. This will create some internal
data structures and return a DialogSetID that can be used to find all the state
asscociates resulting from this. When a response comes into this, a callback
from one of the Handler classes will be called to notify the application about
incoming events. This will pass up some type of client or server usages class
that can be used to send aditional messages and responses inthe context of this
particularr usage of the Dialog.

DialogUsage Manager - Main class that keeps track of all the DialogsSets,
Dialogs, and Usages.
</p><p>
DialogSet - A set of dialogs that were gerneated from a common request. They
share the same call-id and the same from tag in the
request that genreated the dialog.
</p><p>
Dialog - A container holding such things and local and remote CSEQ, URI,
Call-ID and such as defined by the SIP standard.
</p><p>
DialogID - An identifier that uniquely finds a a Dialog by Call-ID, and to and
from tags.
</p><p>
DialogSetID - An identifier that uniquily identifies a Dialog-Set and is formed
from Call-ID and 
</p><p>
Usages - These are the objects are are using a dialog. They include
ClientInviteSession, ClientOutOfDialogReq, ClientPublication,
ClientRegistration, ClientSubscription, ServerInviteSession,
ServerOutOfDialogReq, ServerPublication, ServerRegistration, and
ServerSubscription. These have varios operations that can be called on them to 
</p><p>
Handlers - These are objects uses to derive class from that allow callbacks from
this layer to the application using ti. They include InviteSessionHandler,
OutOfDialogHandler, RegistrationHandler, SubscribeHandler, and
PublictionHandler.
</p><p>
Handles - All the Usaves and Handlers are not really exposes to the
applications using this layer. Instead, handles to them are passed out. When
the applications goes to use a handle, the unerlying object may have been
delted and the applications must be prepared for this not to work.

Initially a cleint can call makeNewInvite on the DUM and get a SipMessage. It
can take this and modify it such as adding SDP. It then calls sends on the DUM
and sends themessage. This will cause the creation of a DialogSet for the
Dialogs resulting from this request. When a responses (such as a 180) comes back
that cuase the creation of an early dialog, the onEarly callback in the Handler
willbe called. This will pass in a ClientInviteSession to the applications and
the eactual message received. When and offer or answer is recived, the onAnswer
or onOffer callback will be called. In the typical case wher the INVITE sent
and offer and the 180 has SDP but it is not an answer, only the onEarly will be
called. If the 180 was reliable so that it was an aswer, then both the onEarly
and the onAnswer would be called.
</p><p>
If the client which to sent a new answer or offer it must call the setAnswer or
setAnswer object with the new SDP. This saves it but does not send a
messages. the client then calls sendAnyAnswer or sendAnyOffer to cause the
aproperate message to be sent to send a new offer or answer. This might be a
PRACK, an UPDATE, a reINVITE depending on the currenst state of the dialog.

When you receive an offer, you need to send an aswer. If you don't like
something about the SIP message with the offer you can totally reject it at the
sip level, but if you don't like the media it proposed, you need to send a
answer with all the m lines you don't like zeroed out. You can then instantly
send a counter offer to propose somethign new.
