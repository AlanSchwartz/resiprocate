Session
- added support for re-invite with no offer

subjectAltName list
  - if no subjectAltName, then commonName is used
  - modified TLS client domain name check to look through all possible
peer names
- implemented RESIP_FIXED_POINT compilation flag

- Framework for better control of forking in repro.
- Improved Processor architecture in repro (with respect to asynchronous work), with helper classes for easily setting up thread-banks for async tasks.
- Support for Q-Value based forking in repro.
- Implemented Timer C in repro.
- Lots and lots of testcases in tfm.
- A variety of new features in tfm.
- support for namespaces in pidf documents
- added a PEDANTIC_STACK build flag that causes the stack to fully parse all incoming messages, and 400 if it finds garbage.


- STUN client support (in UdpTransport class)
- Added capability for adding a MessageDecorator through a dum profile


Fixes:
- fix for shutdown assertions if outstanding invite sessions
- fixed many transactionstate memory leaks
- fix for receiving stray dialog/dialogset matching messages during
delayed destruction
- fix for ending() a registration while in the process of retrying
- use SO_REUSEADDR for windows sockets
- changes so that build with openSSL 0.98 works
- ensure all 4xx responses to invites are handled correctly in dum
- fix to remove race condition in AbstractFifo::getNext(int ms)
- fix for dialogset destruction bug - cleaned up redirect logic used to
destroy dialog, but keep dialogset around
- change ClientSubscription.cxx and ServerSubscription.cxx to send all
messages via the Dialog::send interface, instead of the
DialogUsageManager::send interface.  This allows requests to be tracked
by the Dialog - so that it can correctly respond to Digest challenges.
- fixes to dum states for initiating a BYE while waiting for an ACK
- dum fix for setting correct reason text for NIT responses
- many misc. fixes to InviteSession state machine
- ServerPublication: fix for uninitialized mExpires in onInitial
callback
- fix for early SDP in provisional's (dum)
- allow additional provisionals in EarlyProvidedAnswer state (dum)
- ServerAuthManager - do not challenge ACKS or CANCELs
- VS.NET project files - changed all C-Runtime libraries to use
Multithreaded DLL - consistent with sipX projects
- make subscription state checks non-case sensitive
- fix to SdpContents for duplicate fmtp attributes
- corrected some missing sets of mProposedRemoteSdp
- fixed Glare state handling in dispatchGlare
- fixed mProposedLocalSdp memory leaks auto_ptr::release change to
auto_ptr::reset
- fix for getLocalSdp and getRemoteSdp if values are not yet set
- 2xx retransmission is now detected and handled properly - no more
incorrect handler callbacks (dum)
- fix submitted by Justin Matthews for potential invalid pointer access
of mDnsResult
- fix issue with receiving 2xx retrans when dialog is destroying -
reported by Justin Matthews
- remove trailing spaces from non-quoted display name (NameAddr)
- fix memory leak of SecurityAttributes
- fixed MessageWaitingContents encoder attributes
- be resilient to implementations that send sdp in 200/Update event
though we didn't send an offer (ie. Cisco 7960)
- InviteSession: separate mLastSessionRefresh into
mLastLocalSessionRefresh and mLastRemoteSessionRefresh fixes bug where
remote message headers could get used in outbound requests
- SdpContents: fixed bug in Session::Time operator=
- many openSSL memory leak fixes
- some time_t use fixes so that we compatible with VS.NET 2005's default
definition of time_t - which is a 64-bit integer
- fixed UInt64 conversion for nonce stuff - digest auth was failing 
- fix for calling end on a client SUBSCRIBE (or PUBLISH) dialog before
any response is received
- fixed many transport memory leaks - the biggest one is with receiving
CRLF keep alives on UDP transports
- made domain name cert check for Client SSL connection non-case
sensitive
- fix for computeTag to use passed in size
- fix for CSeqCategory and RAckCategory to use unsigned integers for
sequence numbers
- fix for Tuple IPV6 hash on linux platforms
- ClientRegistration - use Expires header if no Contacts are present
- changed ExpiresCategory.cxx to be an UInt32 so that Expires parameter
can handle up to 2^32-1 as in RFC
- modified dum so that expiration values use UInt32 instead of int for
storage

- Fixed a few assert/memory leak bugs in TransactionState caused by method mismatches between Request Line and CSeq.
- Major fixes to connection management in the stack (including memory corruption bugs)
- Fixed issue where we were sending TLS over the wrong IP version when we had TLS transports on both versions open.
- Fixed many integral-value overflow bugs.
- Fixed a few other parser bugs (for q-value, senthost in Via, branch parameter in Via)
- Fixed Data::hash for non-plaintext.
- Fixed a memory corruption bug in oDataStream.
- implemented auto_ptr based SipStack::post() and postMs()
- Fixed an assert bug in repro's WebAdmin that would allow an unprivileged user to cause an assert.
- Fixed handling of stray CANCELs
- repro no longer will forward 503s


- made codec comparison case insensitive (findFirstMatchingCodec function)
- modified stunTest to use nonblocking socket and selectable timeout
- Added some missing closesocket calls to the rutil\STUN functions
- removed the static "done" check in Security::Initialize(), it caused a bug when the object was instantiated a second time
- Corrected the Codec constructor for telephone-event and frf-dialed-event constants. A payload type of 8000 was used. (Not wrong but usually 101 is used. 8000 rather is the bandwidth)
- Added two more codec constants. (G723 and GSM)
- removed the bogus sleep stuff from stunSendTest
