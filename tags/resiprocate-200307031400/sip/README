The reSIProcate SIP Stack
=========================

    Please see the file INSTALL for generic install instructions.
This file contains additional information about configuring the
reSIProcate build.  For information on compiling reSIProcate for the
Microsoft Windows platform, please see the file README.windows.

External Dependencies
=====================

    The reSIProcate stack can be configured to use the ares
asynchronous DNS resolver which provides advanced DNS query features
and scalability.  The ares resolver is packaged in the contrib/ares
directory and can be installed using a standard `./configure; make;
make install' process prior to building reSIProcate.

Special ./configure Options
===========================

    Most of the standard GNU configuration options are provided by
the configure program.  `cd' to the directory containing the package's
source code and type `./configure --help' for a complete list.
In addition, you may wish to add:

  1. --with-ares[=DIR] to instruct the build to use the ares
     asynchronous resolver as described above.  This is recommended.

  2. --with-openssl[=DIR] to instruct the build to include support
     for SSL.  This activates TLS support in reSIProcate.

  3. --enable-distcc[=DIR] to instruct the build to compile files
     in parallel with the distcc program.
